## 👋 About Me
I am a Computer Science major student at George Mason University ! I am pursuing my career to be a software engineer. 

My interests in computers and programming started when I was ten years old. Using and utilizing software was fascinating, but I was more interested in creating them, so here I am.

As a programmer, I am always persistent in solving the problems I face. Every day, I try to extend my knowledge of coding to be at least a good programmer.
Nice to meet you!
